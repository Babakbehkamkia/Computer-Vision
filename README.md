# Computer-Vision

## HW1
This assignment was an introduction to OpenCV and its functions like cv2.cvtColor, cv2.line, etc.


## HW2
In this assignment, we must find corners of a chessboard and fix its distortion with OpenCV. Then, in order to fine calibration parameters more accurately, we use more images of a chessboard.

## HW3

In the second question of this assignment, I used historgram equalization techniques. Then I used CLAHE and compared two results.

In the third part, I combined two images with histogram matching.

## HW4

In the third question of this assignment, we designed some filters in order to fix the noise of impute images.
Then, in the next question, we must fix the noise of an image with help of the Fourier transform.

## HW5

In this assignment we wanted to fix the noise of an input image and detect the edges of objects in the picture. In the other question, we fined the equation of a line wich perfectly fits on the line in a picture.







## HW6







## HW7


In the first question of this assignment, we get some images from a place and combine them.

In the third question, we implemented a CamScanner.

## HW8



In this assignment, we read the Persian text from a given image. I use Adaptive Threshold for this question.




## HW9









## HW10


In this assignment, we implemented a classifier and we used compactness, eccentricity, solidity, and LBP values as features.





## HW11


First, we implemented two models (one with Conv layers and one without). Then we compared results of these models.
In the next part, we used finetuned Resnet50 after resizing given images.
